Once the EC2 instance is up and running, use a Bash script to install Jenkins and its dependencies



#!/bin/bash

# Check if the script is run with root privileges
if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Please run this script as root or using sudo."
  exit 1
fi

# Update package repositories
apt-get update

# Install Java (required for Jenkins)
apt-get install -y default-jre

# Install Jenkins
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | apt-key add -
echo "deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
apt-get update
apt-get install -y jenkins

# Start Jenkins service
systemctl start jenkins

# Enable Jenkins service to start on boot
systemctl enable jenkins

# Check Jenkins status
systemctl status jenkins

echo "Jenkins setup completed."

EXAMPLE OF A YAML SNIPPET TO DEFINE A SIMPLE JENKINS JOB




1. Configure Jenkins using JCasC:
Create a YAML file (jenkins.yaml) that defines your Jenkins configurations, including jobs, plugins, and other settings.
Refer to the JCasC documentation for details on how to write the YAML file.




yaml script:


jenkins:
  jobs:
    - script: >
        pipeline {
          agent any
          stages {
            stage('Hello') {
              steps {
                echo 'Hello, Jenkins!'
              }
            }
          }
        }

1. Apply Jenkins Configuration:
Use the "Reload Configuration from Disk" option in the "Jenkins Configuration as Code" section to apply the changes defined in your jenkins.yaml file.

With this setup, Jenkins will be installed and configured with your defined jobs and plugins automatically whenever you launch a new EC2 instance. 
You can further customize the Jenkins configuration YAML to suit your specific needs.

Remember to ensure that you understand the security implications of running Jenkins on AWS and take necessary measures to secure your Jenkins server (e.g., setting up authentication, using HTTPS, etc.).
