---------------------------END OF BASH SCRIPT------------------------------------------------------------




Save this script in a file, e.g., setup_ansible.sh, and make it executable using the following command:


    chmod +x setup_ansible.sh
Then, you can run the script with root privileges to automate the installation of Ansible:


    sudo ./setup_ansible.sh

The script first checks if it is run with root privileges (necessary for package installation). 
Then, it updates the package repositories, installs Ansible and its dependencies, and finally, displays the installed Ansible version.

Please note that the script assumes you are using Ubuntu/Debian-based Linux distributions. 
If you are using CentOS/RHEL, you can follow the commented lines in the script to install Ansible using yum instead of apt-get.

Before running the script, ensure you understand the implications of installing software on your server and have the necessary permissions to perform the installation. 
Also, consider customizing the script to meet your specific requirements or to add any additional configurations or packages that might be needed for your Ansible setup.
